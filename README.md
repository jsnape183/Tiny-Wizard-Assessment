Tiny Wizard Assessment

Overview
The goal of this assessment is to evaluate the candidates ability to produce clear and concise code  by creating a simple code sample.
In this assessment you will be asked to implement the A* pathfinding algorithm to enable a charcter sprite to navigate a 2D grid of tiles using the mouse cursor. The code produced in this exercise should be considered acceptable for production use.

Steps:
1) Produce a 20x20 grid of tiles, using the Wall and Floor assets.
2) Place the Player sprite in the grid
3) Implement an A* algorithm which allows the player to move to the position where the mouse was clicked.
  a) If the player clicks out of the grid the character should not move.
  b) If the player clicks on a wall tile the character should not move.
4) Ensure the code is readable with appropriate data structures and would be fit for use in production.
